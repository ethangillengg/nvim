- [ ] [ray-x/navigator.lua](https://github.com/ray-x/navigator.lua) - Learn existing code quickly and navigate code like a breeze. A swiss army knife makes exploring LSP and üå≤Treesitter symbols a piece of üç∞.

- [ ] [mrjones2014/legendary.nvim](https://github.com/mrjones2014/legendary.nvim) - Define your keymaps, commands, and autocommands as simple Lua tables, and create a legend for them at the same time (like VS Code's Command Palette), integrates with `which-key.nvim`.
- [ ] [rktjmp/lush.nvim](https://github.com/rktjmp/lush.nvim)
- [ ] [themercorp/themer.lua](https://github.com/themercorp/themer.lua)
