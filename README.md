## Plugins

### Must Have

- [ ] [SmiteshP/nvim-navic](https://github.com/SmiteshP/nvim-navic) - A simple statusline/winbar component that uses LSP to show your current code context.
- [ ] [b0o/incline.nvim](https://github.com/b0o/incline.nvim) - Lightweight floating statuslines, intended for use with Neovim's new global statusline.
- [ ] [RRethy/vim-illuminate](https://github.com/RRethy/vim-illuminate) - Highlight the word under the cursor. Neovim's builtin LSP is available, it can be used to highlight more intelligently.

### Test First

- [ ] [mrjones2014/legendary.nvim](https://github.com/mrjones2014/legendary.nvim) - Define your keymaps, commands, and autocommands as simple Lua tables, and create a legend for them at the same time (like VS Code's Command Palette), integrates with `which-key.nvim`.
